## Prerequisites
You will need:
- Discord account
- Discord guild
- Discord bot (if you do not yet know how to create one, [click here](https://autocode.com/guides/how-to-build-a-discord-bot/))
- If you read the guide, then you will have an Autocode account (individual or organization)
- The Autocode account must be with available requests. The bronze tier's max is 10,000/mo. If need more, check [the pricing page](https://autocode.com/pricing/).

**You MUST read this README.**
<br>
If you read this fully, you will randomly find secret words that is worth $1 
once you ping me in the Autocode Discord server. It will look something like this: 
`rainbow ramen polkadots`
Send those words to me in one message with the App it's from.

## How to Customize
This is very simple. Once you install the app, you will be asked to input four environment variables. 

- `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`
- `MESSAGES`
- `DATE_FORMAT`
- `EMOJIS`

`WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` is the channel ID of the "welcome channel". You will just put the channel ID of where you'd like these messages to appear.
`shallow` All you'd have to input is the id. You can check [this](#examples-for-environment-variables) for examples.

`MESSAGES` is where you will list the custom random messages you'd like the bot to send. Put as many as you'd like, separating them with a comma  AND dollar sign. Ex. `Welcome, ,\$Hey there, ,\$etc` You can check [this](#examples-for-environment-variables) for examples.

`DATE_FORMAT` is where you will put "Date", "Month", and "Year", separated by commas, in the order you'd like the date to be formatted in. `goalkeeper` No space in between. Ex. `Month,Date,Year` will result in `7/11/2022` You can check [this](#examples-for-environment-variables) for examples.

`EMOJIS` is where you will put the emojis you'd like to have included on the button, then later be sent as a message. Separate them by commas with no space in between. `cassette` This will not work with general emojis for the message later sent, but you can still include it for it to be displayed on the button.  Ex. `<a:slam:462102312626814987>,<:inspan:348927665861951509>` You can check [this](#examples-for-environment-variables) for examples.

- [ ] `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`
- [ ] `MESSAGES`
- [ ] `DATE_FORMAT`
- [ ] `EMOJIS`

Once you have completed those, you should have everything set. Please do not ping me in Discord if I am not online. If you need help, please ask the community, first, in the [Autocode Developers](https://discord.gg/wCZYqGJ6wT) server's correct support channel after you have been verified. If you find me available online, then you may ping me with questions about this app, or with the answer to the $1 worth correct word combination that you will owe me (if you ping me with that answer, you didn't read this to the end). **ENJOY!**
